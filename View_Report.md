# What Was Done:

## 1. Set Up Simulink with Arduino:
- Installed the tools needed to make Simulink work with an Arduino board.
- Tested the connection by making the LED on the Arduino blink.
  
## 2. Controlled the LED:
- Made a program to control the blinking of the LED and adjusted how fast it blinked using Simulink.
  
## 3. Real-Time Communication:
- Used External Mode to adjust settings (like brightness) on the LED while the program was running.
## 4. Tested Speed Limits:
- Found out how fast the Arduino could handle the program without messing up by testing with very short execution times.

## Tried two modes: 
**Normal Mode** (runs faster but can't adjust while running) and **External Mode** (lets you adjust settings in real-time but is slower).

# Conclusion: 
This lab was about learning how to use Simulink with an Arduino to control an LED and test how fast the Arduino can run a program. 
I set up the tools, made the LED blink, and adjusted its brightness in real time using External Mode. 
I also tested how quickly the Arduino could handle the code without errors and compared two modes: 
Normal Mode (faster but no live adjustments) and External Mode (slower but allows changes while running). 
Overall, the lab taught me how to control hardware, test performance, and use the best mode for different situations.
